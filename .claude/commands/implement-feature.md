Please implement the feature: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps (Test-Driven Development workflow):

1. Analyze relevant parts of the current codebase
2. Create an implementation plan (think harder)
3. Write tests first (and verify they fail)
4. Commit tests
5. Implement the code (iterate until tests pass)
6. Format code and run linter
7. Update `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` with the new feature
8. Commit implementation
