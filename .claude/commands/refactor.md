Please refactor the code: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps (Safe Refactoring workflow):

1. Create a new branch for the refactoring work
2. Analyze the current code structure and identify areas for improvement
3. Ensure existing tests pass (run `bun test`)
4. Plan the refactoring approach (preserve behavior, improve structure)
5. Make incremental changes with frequent test runs
6. Extract static values outside functions/components per code style rules
7. Maintain or improve test coverage
8. Run linter and fix any issues (`bun lint`)
9. Verify all functionality still works as expected
10. Commit refactored code with clear commit message
